# Threads-Synchronization
## Overview
The News Broadcasting Simulation project is designed to provide hands-on experience with concurrent programming and synchronization mechanisms. The goal is to implement a system that simulates news broadcasting, where different types of news stories are produced, sorted, and displayed to the public. The project explores the impact of synchronization constructs under different loads.
